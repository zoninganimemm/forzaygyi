            MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Wisconsin Republicans proposed a constitutional
            amendment Wednesday that would curtail the governor's veto powers by
            prohibiting a veto to increase any tax or fee. The move comes after
            Democratic Gov. Tony Evers used his partial veto in July to increase
            school funding for public schools for the next 400 years.
            Republicans proposed a similar amendment in 2019 after Evers used
            his partial veto to increase school funding by $65 million, but it
            did not get a vote in the Legislature. Wisconsin governors have the
            most expansive partial veto power in the country because, unlike in
            other states, they can strike nearly any part of a budget bill. That
            includes wiping out numbers, punctuation and words in spending bills
            to sometimes create new law that wasn’t the intention of the
            Legislature. Wisconsin’s partial veto power was created by a 1930
            constitutional amendment but has been weakened over the years,
            including in reaction to vetoes made by prior Democratic and
            Republican governors. Republicans have increasingly been turning to
            constitutional amendments to get around Evers' vetoes. The
            amendments are not subject to approval by governors. If passed by
            the Legislature in two consecutive sessions, they are then put on
            the ballot for voter approval. That means the soonest the latest
            proposal could be adopted would be 2025. “If adopted, this amendment
            would appropriately rebalance power between the executive and the
            legislature and further restrict the executive from completely
            rewriting laws that are not representative of the people,”
            Republicans who introduced the measure said in an email seeking
            co-sponsors. The lawmakers proposing the measure are state Sen. Dan
            Knodl and state Reps. Amanda Nedweski, Joel Kitchens and Shae
            Sortwell.
